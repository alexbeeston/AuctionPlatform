Setup instructions
------------------
install python 3 (not anaconda)
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
  verify: type python or python3 in terminal

install pip (python package manager)
  I have included the get-pip.py file in the repo
  in terminal run:
    python (or python3) get-pip.py
  
install pipenv (an upgraded version of pip)
  pip install pipenv

from this point, anytime we need to add packages (such as django) we need to use our environment
to active the env:
  pipenv sell

our pip file has a list of all the packages that we need for the project, aka our dependencies, (including django)
to install all dependencies, run:
  pipenv install

you should be ready to roll
