Setup instructions
------------------
install python 3 (not anaconda)
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
  verify: type python or python3 in terminal

install pip (python package manager)
  I have included the get-pip.py file in the repo
  in terminal run:
    python (or python3) get-pip.py
  
install pipenv (an upgraded version of pip)
  pip install pipenv

From this point, anytime we want to install any python package (such as django) we have to activate our environment
To activate, run:
  pipenv shell

Install django in environment
  pipenv install django

you should be ready to roll
