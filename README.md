  We will be using Git. 
  Each user story will be it's own small branch.
  Each pull request will be reviewed by at least 1 other team member.
## Tool stack description and setup procedure
  We will be using django version 2.2 for the backend.
  We will be using python version 3.7 as part of the django backend.
  The database will be in SQL, which is default in django.
  We will be using HTML5 and Javascript to design the frontend.
  We will potentially be using a framework, such as React.js, for frontend assistance.
## Build instructions
  We will be building an independ python environment to run the backend using the venv command.
  We don't exactly know how this will work yet. Stay tuned...
